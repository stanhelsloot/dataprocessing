    <h1>BMI data of the world</h1>
    <p>By Stan Helsloot, student number 10762388.</p>
    <p>The following page shows the BMI data per country in a map. When clicking on the map, the average male BMI per year from 1975 to 2016 is displayed in a graph for that specific country.</p>
    <p>Hovering over a country in the map will display the BMI data from 2016 and show the name of the country.</p>
    <p>The data was not available for several countries which are displayed in red.</p>
    <p>Moving over the graph with your mouse will display year specific BMI data from the chosen country.</p>
    <p>The legend of the worldmap was based on code from http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/5397362</p>
    <p>The tooltip of the linechart was made by combining pieces of code from https://bl.ocks.org/alandunning/cfb7dcd7951826b9eacd54f0647f48d3 and http://bl.ocks.org/wdickerson/64535aff478e8a9fd9d9facccfef8929 (and of course altering the code so it works :)</p>
    <p>The data from the datasets originated from "http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/raw/8e15870eb432a21f0bc4d3d527b2d14f/a45e8709648cafbbf01c78c76dfa53e31087e713/world_countries.json" for the geographical data for the drawing of the worldmap and from http://ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-adiposity.html the BMI data was acquierd (country specific data for all countries)</p>
    <p>The BMI data was converted twice using the "csvconverter.py" program (which can be found in the GIT page corresponding to this assignment); once for 2016 and once for all years.</p>
    <p>Also a big thanks to Justin Palmer for usage of his tooltip script.</p>
